The goal of atgnat is to enable you to map bulk RNA-seq samples onto
Single Cell RNA-seq for further analysis, with an emphasis on
trajectories (but it can work for any continuous variable across your
data!).

## Installation

You can install the development version of atgnat from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("andrewmccluskey-uog/atgnat")
```

## Getting Started

Take a look at the Vignette for use with a Single Cell Experiment.
