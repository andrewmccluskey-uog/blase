\title{Map the best matching SC bin for a bulk sample}
\usage{
map_best_bin(atgnat_data, bulk_id, bulk_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{atgnat_data}{The \link{AtgnatData} holding the bins.}

\item{bulk_id}{The sample id of the bulk to analyse}

\item{bulk_data}{The whole bulk read matrix}
}
\value{
A dataframe with one row, containing results from the mapping process.
\itemize{
\item Bin: the bin that best matched the bulk sample.
\item Corr: the spearman's rho that the test geneset had between the winning bin and the bulk.
\item top_2_distance: the absolute difference between the best and second best mapping buckets. Higher indicates a less doubtful mapping.
\item history: a dataframe of the correlation score for each bin.
