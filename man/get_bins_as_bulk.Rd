\title{Get a pseudobulk of bins with at least 2 replicates}
\usage{
get_bins_as_bulk(
  pseudotime_sce,
  min_cells_for_bulk = 50,
  replicate_slot = "replicate"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pseudotime_sce}{The Single Cell Experiment object to get the bins from}

\item{min_cells_for_bulk}{The minimum cells to look for per replicate and bin.}

\item{replicate_slot}{The slot in the Single Cell Experiment that contains replicate information}
}
\value{
A dataframe pseudobulk counts matrix.
}
\description{
This function will try to create a pseudobulked count matrix for the bins.
When a replicate has too few cells, it is discounted. If only one exists,
then we sample from it twice to create the pseudobulks.
}
